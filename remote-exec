remote-exec Provisioner
The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. 
This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc.
To invoke a local process, see the local-exec provisioner instead. 
The remote-exec provisioner requires a connection and supports both ssh and winrm.
