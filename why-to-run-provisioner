-----------------When to Run the Provisioners?---------------------------------------------
It is possible to specify when the provisioners should run. Terraform mainly performs two operations – apply and destroy. 
If we want to run the provisioner to handle some logic at creation time, then we use the creation-time provisioner. 
Similarly, if we want to handle the destroy-time scenario differently, we use the destroy-time provisioners.

The “when” attribute used in the provisioner block determines whether a provisioner is creation-time or destroy-time.
By default, if the “when” attribute is not specified, the provisioner runs at creation time. In the example below,
we create separate text files that contain event-specific messages for both create and destroy events.



resource "aws_instance" "my_vm" {
 ami           = var.ami //Amazon Linux AMI
 instance_type = var.instance_type
 
 provisioner "local-exec" {
   command = "echo 'Creation is successful.' >> creation.txt"
 }
 
 provisioner "local-exec" {
   when = destroy
   command = "echo 'Destruction is successful.' >> destruction.txt"
 }
 
 tags = {
   Name = var.name_tag,
 }
}
